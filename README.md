### Data Structure Term Project
#### File structure implementation using Btree
A file structure hierarchy has been implemented using BTree data structure. In the project we created two classes File and OS in order to simulate a file hierarchy.
The basic operations :
* Insert![](outputs/insert.PNG)
* Search![](outputs/search.PNG)
* Delete![](outputs/delete.PNG)
* Traverse![](outputs/traverse.PNG)
have all been performed on the datastructure.
